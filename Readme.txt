Features
	Summary
	3D Models
	The implementation of the 3d model was to put the rendering of it in the 3Dmodel file where the class of the models was there as well as the binding of buffers.
	Skybox
	The implementation of the code was similar on the code that was discussed during class about skyboxes
	Lighting
	The code used was similar on how we did the pc02 and just implemented some new ones that fit the requirement of the mp
	Cameras
	Implemented the mouse movement for the camera as well as implemented the 3rd person and first person camera by changing its position. Another is the movement of the camera using the mouse which was also implemented from the previous programming challenge. The orthographic camera wasn’t properly implemented.
	Player Input
	The implementation of the inputs was based on how it was also discussed in class and changed its functions per key depending on what was being asked
	OOP
	Made separate files for the oop which are the models, light, camera, shader. Integrated some of the codes from the previous programming challenge and added new ones.
